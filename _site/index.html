            73% of U.S. Small Business Reported Cyber Attacks Last Year
          </a>
        </h3>
          <p>A significant portion of small business leaders who responded to the Identity Theft Resource Centerâ€™s 2023 Business Impact Survey reported experiencing cyberattacks, highlighting the presence of malicious actors causing substantial harm. The 2023 research recorded that 73% of breaches involved data, security, or both.</p>

<p>Test</p>

<p>Employee and consumer data continue to be the most impacted categories of information impacted by a breach. This is because these types of data often include sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and other cybercrimes.</p>

<p>In 2023, the main reasons for security breaches changed compared to the past years. Outside attackers, rogue employees, remote workers, and third-party vendors were the top culprits. Meanwhile, breaches caused by phishing and scams were more common, which is pretty much whatâ€™s been happening everywhere.</p>

<p>The financial impacts of cyber breaches continued to drop compared to previous years, with more SMBs reporting losses of &lt;$250,000 and fewer reporting higher dollar-value events. The trend of decreasing financial losses from cyberattacks shows improved cybersecurity measures and awareness among businesses. Several factors contribute to this decline: increased awareness, law enforcement efforts, and cybersecurity insurance. However, the threat remains significant, and businesses must prioritize cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Despite some progress, cyberattacks continue to pose a serious threat to small businesses. While the financial impact of cyber breaches has decreased, the impact on employee and consumer data remains significant.</p>

<p>Looking forward in this era of technology-driven businesses, business managers face the challenge of striking a balance between cost-effectiveness and maximizing the returns on their IT investments. Solutions like Co-managed IT services have emerged as a strategic solution for growing companies. These services provide a dedicated focus on core operations while leveraging specialized knowledge and resources, enabling businesses to optimize their IT infrastructure strategically.</p>
