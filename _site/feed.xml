<h2 id="gdp-growth-rate">GDP Growth Rate</h2>
<p>In the dynamic landscape of economics, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as a vital barometer, reflecting the overall health and performance of a country‚Äôs economy. With the release of the first estimate for the first quarter of 2024, business owners eagerly awaited insights into the trajectory of the United States‚Äô economic growth. Let‚Äôs delve into the recent data and its implications.</p>

<p><strong>The forecasted GDP growth rate for the second quarter of 2024 stands at 1.5%</strong>, indicating a slowdown from the previous quarter‚Äôs 2.4%. This deceleration suggests that while the economy is still expanding, the pace of growth is slowing. For business owners, this may signal a need for cautious optimism, focusing on maintaining stability and efficiency rather than aggressive expansion.</p>

<h2 id="key-market-indicators">Key Market Indicators</h2>

<h3 id="inflation-rate">Inflation Rate</h3>
<p><strong>The US inflation rate is currently at 3.36%</strong>, a slight decrease from 3.48% last month and significantly lower than 4.93% a year ago. However, it remains above the long-term average of 3.28%.</p>

<h3 id="real-estate-market">Real Estate Market</h3>
<p><strong>The price per square foot in April was $230</strong>, up 3.6% from $222 in April of last year. The increase in real estate prices may reflect ongoing demand and potential constraints in supply.</p>

<h3 id="housing-market">Housing Market</h3>
<p><strong>The US median asking rent has risen to $1,459</strong>, a significant 11.63% increase from $1,307 one year ago. The sharp rise in rental costs can affect consumer patterns, as higher housing costs reduce disposable income.</p>

<h3 id="automotive-market">Automotive Market</h3>
<p><strong>The average price for a new car in March was $47,218</strong>, a decrease of 1% from March 2023 and a 5.4% drop from the market peak in December 2022. The decline in car prices suggests a cooling off in the automotive market, potentially due to changes in consumer demand.</p>

<h3 id="insurance-costs">Insurance Costs</h3>
<p><strong>The national average cost of car insurance is $2,004 per year for full coverage</strong> and $624 per year for minimum coverage. The costs of insurance are significant for both individuals and businesses, affecting overall operating expenses and consumer spending power.</p>

<h3 id="retail-gas-prices">Retail Gas Prices</h3>
<p><strong>The US retail gas price is at a current level of $3.698</strong>, down from $3.706 last week and up from $3.645 one year ago. Fluctuating gas prices can influence transportation costs and labor shortages.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>As we progress through 2024, the economic landscape presents several challenges and opportunities. With GDP growth slowing to 1.5% in the second quarter, businesses should prioritize efficiency and stability. Inflation remains above the long-term average, making cost control essential. Rising real estate and rent prices could impact expansion plans and consumer spending, while lower car prices reflect shifting demand in the automotive market. High insurance expenses continue to be a significant cost, and fluctuating gas prices will affect transportation costs. As a business owner, staying informed and adaptable will be crucial for navigating these economic shifts effectively.</p>

<p>First, let‚Äôs create a ‚Äúdockerfile‚Äù with the necessary instructions to build our image.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-docker" data-lang="docker">  <span class="c"># Dockerfile for Jekyll using Ubuntu</span>
  FROM ubuntu:latest
  <span class="c"># Install necessary packages</span>
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
      apt-get install -y ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git &amp;&amp; \
      git config --global init.defaultBranch main
  <span class="c"># Install Jekyll and Bundler</span>
  RUN gem install bundler jekyll
  <span class="c"># Set the working directory inside the container</span>
  WORKDIR /srv/jekyll</code></pre></figure>

<p>Proceed to build the image ‚Äújekyll-ubuntu‚Äù using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; docker build -t jekyll-ubuntu .</code></p>

<p>Run a container, mount the volume ‚Äúghpages‚Äù, and execute a ‚Äúbash‚Äù terminal using this command</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-docker" data-lang="docker">  &gt; docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -p 35729:35729 -v ghpages:/srv/jekyll jekyll-ubuntu bash</code></pre></figure>

<p>Create a new jekyll site, then launch the local server</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">  <span class="nv">$ </span>jekyll new <span class="nb">.</span>
  <span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve <span class="nt">--host</span> 0.0.0.0 <span class="nt">--livereload</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you already have an existing volume with a jekyll site, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new .</code> then launch the server</p>

<p>Finally, simply connect to the container via Visual Studio Code and designate ‚Äú/srv/jekyll‚Äù as your workspace to begin crafting your Jekyll blog.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="coding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unleash the power of Docker for a hassle-free Jekyll blog setup and deployment.
