<p>Employee and consumer data continue to be the most impacted categories of information impacted by a breach. This is because these types of data often include sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and other cybercrimes.</p>

<p>In 2023, the main reasons for security breaches changed compared to the past years. Outside attackers, rogue employees, remote workers, and third-party vendors were the top culprits. Meanwhile, breaches caused by phishing and scams were more common, which is pretty much what‚Äôs been happening everywhere.</p>

<p>The financial impacts of cyber breaches continued to drop compared to previous years, with more SMBs reporting losses of &lt;$250,000 and fewer reporting higher dollar-value events. The trend of decreasing financial losses from cyberattacks shows improved cybersecurity measures and awareness among businesses. Several factors contribute to this decline: increased awareness, law enforcement efforts, and cybersecurity insurance. However, the threat remains significant, and businesses must prioritize cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Despite some progress, cyberattacks continue to pose a serious threat to small businesses. While the financial impact of cyber breaches has decreased, the impact on employee and consumer data remains significant.</p>

<p>Looking forward in this era of technology-driven businesses, business managers face the challenge of striking a balance between cost-effectiveness and maximizing the returns on their IT investments. Solutions like Co-managed IT services have emerged as a strategic solution for growing companies. These services provide a dedicated focus on core operations while leveraging specialized knowledge and resources, enabling businesses to optimize their IT infrastructure strategically.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="cybersecurity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A significant portion of small business leaders who responded to the Identity Theft Resource Center‚Äôs 2023 Business Impact Survey reported experiencing cyberattacks, highlighting the presence of malicious actors causing substantial harm.

<p>First, let‚Äôs create a ‚Äúdockerfile‚Äù with the necessary instructions to build our image.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-docker" data-lang="docker">  <span class="c"># Dockerfile for Jekyll using Ubuntu</span>
  FROM ubuntu:latest
  <span class="c"># Install necessary packages</span>
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
      apt-get install -y ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git &amp;&amp; \
      git config --global init.defaultBranch main
  <span class="c"># Install Jekyll and Bundler</span>
  RUN gem install bundler jekyll
  <span class="c"># Set the working directory inside the container</span>
  WORKDIR /srv/jekyll</code></pre></figure>

<p>Proceed to build the image ‚Äújekyll-ubuntu‚Äù using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; docker build -t jekyll-ubuntu .</code></p>

<p>Run a container, mount the volume ‚Äúghpages‚Äù, and execute a ‚Äúbash‚Äù terminal using this command</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-docker" data-lang="docker">  &gt; docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -p 35729:35729 -v ghpages:/srv/jekyll jekyll-ubuntu bash</code></pre></figure>

<p>Create a new jekyll site, then launch the local server</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">  <span class="nv">$ </span>jekyll new <span class="nb">.</span>
  <span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve <span class="nt">--host</span> 0.0.0.0 <span class="nt">--livereload</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you already have an existing volume with a jekyll site, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new .</code> then launch the server</p>

<p>Finally, simply connect to the container via Visual Studio Code and designate ‚Äú/srv/jekyll‚Äù as your workspace to begin crafting your Jekyll blog.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="coding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unleash the power of Docker for a hassle-free Jekyll blog setup and deployment.
